# Latitudes Weather Analysis Visualization

- **_Latitudes Weather Analysis_** - Is a <a href="https://jayhjman.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/" target="_blank">HTML Visualization</a> that summarizes a weather analysis on a set ~500 cities in the given data set. These cities are then applied to a series of plots that compare latitude to 4 weather attributes, Max Temp, Humiditiy, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed.

## Files

- [`maxtemp.html`](./WebVisualizations/maxtemp.html) - Max Temperature page that decribes the analysis for temperature across the latitudes

- [`humidity.html`](./WebVisualizations/humidity.html) - Humidity page that decribes the analysis for temperature across the latitudes

- [`cloudiness.html`](./WebVisualizations/cloudiness.html) - Cloudiness page that decribes the analysis for temperature across the latitudes

- [`windspeed.html`](./WebVisualizations/windspeed.html) - Wind Speed page that decribes the analysis for temperature across the latitudes

- [`comparisions.html`](./WebVisualizations/comparisions.html) - Comparision page that Shows all 4 plots together (Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed)
