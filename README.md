# Latitudes Weather Analysis Visualization

- **_Latitudes Weather Analysis_** - Is a [HTML Visualization](https://jayhjman.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/) that summarizes a weather analysis on a set ~500 cities in the given data set. These cities are then applied to a series of plots that compare latitude to 4 weather attributes, Max Temp, Humiditiy, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed.

## Files

- [`index.html`](index.html) - Initial landing page for the visualizaton

- [`maxtemp.html`](./WebVisualization/maxtemp.html) - Max Temperature page that decribes the analysis for temperature across the latitudes

- [City Data](WeatherPy/output_data/cities.csv) - City data output file generate to be used by [VacationPy.ipynb](VacationPy/VacationPy.ipynb)

- [City Data](WeatherPy/output_data/cities.csv) - City data which was generated from [WeatherPy.ipynb](WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb)
